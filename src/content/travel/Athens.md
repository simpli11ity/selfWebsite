### Solo trip to Greece.
To get from Eleftherios Venizelos airport to Constitution square ( Syntagma Square ), a historic and central square in Athens fronting the Hellenic Parliament you must take a bus after midnight.  Beyond that I had travelled to and fro via the metro beating the harsh city traffic.  I arrived late at night, 2am at the hostel I had stayed in so the plan was to settle in before venturing out the next day.



# The Marathon

Aften waking around midday, I strolled across the city making my way aroud different streets taking in the sprawing layout around the center,  the origional plan was to walk around one of the National gardens but followed a large crowd towards the Panathenaic Stadium,  the 42nd Marathon was taking place, luckily there was free entry on the day.  I ended up climbing to the top of the stadium and soaking in the sun as it set behind Ardittos hill.

A stone greek theatre structure located on the southwest slope of the Acropolis of Athens.
In ancient times, Odeons were built for musical contests and this ancient stone theatre has gone on to host some of the world’s best musical performances during the last 60 years since its modern day re-opening, including Nana Mouskouri, Luciano Pavarotti and Frank Sinatra to name a few.
