### Solo trip to Alicante. 
Short journey from the airport to the middle of Alicante, a short 5 minute walk from the epitimy of a tourist area. Interacting with people within these areas show an ignorance and bias if they presume you to be English.  In general the city at all hours even into the night was remarkably safe walking solo, male or female were out at all hours.

# The Majestic Santa Bárbara Castle

Perched atop Mount Benacantil, Santa Bárbara Castle stands as a testament to history's embrace. A relic of bygone battles, its walls whisper tales of resilience. Ascend to its sun-kissed heights, where an elevator ride near the MARQ museum unveils a panorama of the city's splendor. The journey, though steep, is a pilgrimage through time, amidst stone, gravel, and cement paths. Here, history stands tall, casting its shadow upon Alicante.  

# Parque El Palmeral

Amidst the urban bustle lies Parque El Palmeral, a sanctuary of palms and serenity. Venture an hour from the tourist epicenter and stumble upon this hidden gem, where artificial streams weave tales of calm amidst verdant groves. Unwind amidst 2000 varieties of palm trees, as the park becomes a stage for leisure and laughter. Here, time slows, inviting you to embrace the essence of Alicante's soul.  It is a haven for people watching.

Traverse the Explanada de España, a maritime promenade where history and modernity intertwine. Lined with palm trees offering respite from the sun's embrace, it echoes with the footsteps of time. Born from the remnants of an old dike, it emerges as a mosaic of memories, linking the Sea gate to Canalejas park.

# MARQ Museum

Perplexed by its modest size; though some might say average - I stepped into the archaeological museum with a mix of curiosity and anticipation. Here, the MARQ Museum unveiled a fascinating journey into the depths of excavation, offering a unique portrayal of archaeological dig sites and the techniques employed. Divided into thematic sections spanning maritime exploits to wartime legacies, the main hall echoed with the whispers of history, inviting visitors to delve deeper into Alicante's rich past.  While giving a great depiction of its prehistory, it is very quick to tour and was coupled with other events that day.
